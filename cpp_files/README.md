Precompiled binary executables (tested on UKB-RAP) are provided for tools used for estimating inherited allele lengths via imputation (``computeIBSpbwt`` and ``imputeIRRs``). C++ code for estimating mean somatic expansion of mid-length alleles (``find_repeats_chr2_232_4Mb.cpp`` and ``find_repeats_chr19_14_8Mb.cpp``) has no dependencies and can easily be compiled as indicated in the comment lines at the top of these files.
